"Assalamu'alaikum..
mohon maaf sebelumnya kepada Bapak Ibu di tempat. tanpa mengurangi rasa hormat.
saya menyayangkan oleh pihak BAA. contoh : ketika mengurus biodata diri.
kenapa biodata diri tidak bisa di akses mandiri oleh mahasiswa?
karena ketika ada mahasiswa yang menulis biodata diri terdapat ada kesalahan, mungkin bisa memperbarui sendiri. terimakasih
  ","Assalamu'alaikum..
apologize in advance to the ladies and gentlemen on the spot. with all due respect.
I regret it by BAA. example: when managing personal biodata.
Why can't students access their personal data independently?
because when a student writes their personal bio there are errors, maybe they can update it themselves. Thank You

"Sebelumnya saya mengalami kendala untuk memunculkan nilai Lifeskills pada transkrip nilai. Dari Dosen PA telah divalidasi sehingga saya menginfokan Sekprodi saya. Sekprodi saya menginfokan ke BAA namun sampai 5 hari kerja belum muncul nilai Lifeskill saya di transkrip nilai. Saya juga sudah mengajukan melalui menu perubahan nilai dan klaim nilai ke transkrip. Karena prodi ilmu komunikasi saat ini sedang tahap perpindahan kurikulum baru sehingga nilai lifeskills perlu saya konversikan 2x menjadi mata kuliah magang dan lifeskill. Pada mata kuliah magang nilai berhasil dikonversi melalui menu perubahan nilai melalui progdi. Namun ketika saya mengajukan konversi mata kuliah keterampilan berkehidupan menjadi mata kuliah lifeskills melalui menu perubahan nilai melalui progdi, ajuan saya ditolak dan disarankan mengajukan ulang melalui menu klaim nilai ke transkrip. Saya melanjutkan dengan mengajukan klaim nilai ke transkrip namun tidak ada hasil selama 2 hari kerja. Selain itu saya sudah menghubungi nomor whatsapp BAA namun whatsapp tidak aktif. Saya juga coba menghubungi melalui e-mail namun tidak mendapatkan respon. Alhamdulillah nilai lifeskills saya akhirnya muncul di transkrip dengan bantuan salah satu staf BKUI yang langsung mendatangi BAA. Mungkin karena saya berada di luar pulau dan saya hanya bisa mengurus via daring sehingga responnya jauh berbeda ketika mengurus langsung di kantor BAA. Saran saya karena saat ini masih pandemi dan insyaAllah kedepannya layanan digital sangat berperan dalam jalannya sebuah institusi, semoga pelayanan daring di BAA lebih fast respon agar antara pelayanan daring maupun luring tidak terjadi ketimpangan yang jauh.","Previously I had problems displaying the Lifeskills value on the transcript. The PA lecturer had validated it so I informed my study program secretary. My Study Program Secretary informed BAA but after 5 working days my Lifeskill score had not appeared on my transcript. I have also submitted via the value change menu and claimed the value on the transcript. Because the communication science study program is currently in the stage of moving to a new curriculum, I need to convert the life skills scores twice into internship and life skills courses. In the internship course, grades were successfully converted via the grade change menu in the study program. However, when I applied for the conversion of a life skills course into a life skills course via the grade change menu through the study program, my application was rejected and I was advised to resubmit via the claim grade to transcript menu. I continued by submitting a grade claim to the transcript but there were no results for 2 working days. Apart from that, I have contacted BAA's WhatsApp number but WhatsApp is not active. I also tried to contact via e-mail but did not get a response. Thank God my life skills scores finally appeared on the transcript with the help of one of the BKUI staff who went straight to BAA. Maybe because I'm outside the island and I can only take care of it online so the response is much different when taking care of it directly at the BAA office. My suggestion is that because currently there is still a pandemic and God willing, in the future digital services will play a very important role in the running of an institution, I hope that online services at BAA respond more quickly so that there are no large disparities between online and offline services.","previously i had problems displaying the lifeskills value on the transcript. the pa lecturer had validated it so i informed my study program secretary. my study program secretary informed baa but after 5 working days my lifeskill score had not appeared on my transcript. i have also submitted via the value change menu and claimed the value on the transcript. because the communication science study program is currently in the stage of moving to a new curriculum, i need to convert the life skills scores twice into internship and life skills courses. in the internship course, grades were successfully converted via the grade change menu in the study program. however, when i applied for the conversion of a life skills course into a life skills course via the grade change menu through the study program, my application was rejected and i was advised to resubmit via the claim grade to transcript menu. i continued by submitting a grade claim to the transcript but there were no results for 2 working days. apart from that, i have contacted baa's whatsapp number but whatsapp is not active. i also tried to contact via e-mail but did not get a response. thank god my life skills scores finally appeared on the transcript with the help of one of the bkui staff who went straight to baa. maybe because i'm outside the island and i can only take care of it online so the response is much different when taking care of it directly at the baa office. my suggestion is that because currently there is still a pandemic and god willing, in the future digital services will play a very important role in the running of an institution, i hope that online services at baa respond more quickly so that there are no large disparities between online and offline services."

My possible advice to the staff is, I apologize in advance if it seems rude, but this is not the first time I have encountered staff whose service is very unfriendly, it even seems as if they are reluctant to help and are harsh when dealing with students.

"Alhamdulillah selama saya menjadi mahasiswa UMS, saya tidak banyak menemukan masalah yang begitu serius berkaitan dengan kinerja layanan BAA UMS. Dilihat dari pelayanannya, menurut saya petugas juga cukup ramah dan cekatan. Jika pun ditemukan sebaliknya, mungkin terdapat beberapa kesalahpahaman antara mahasiswa dan petugas. Hal tersebut sangat wajar terjadi. Menurut saya satu permasalahan yang sering dikeluhkan adalah perubahan jadwal dan tagihan yang mendadak. Permasalahan berkenaan dengan perubahan jadwal biasanya hanya disampaikan lewat satu orang ke orang lainnya tanpa ada pengumuman resmi (misalnya, penundaan penutupan unggah artikel ICOLAE). Tagihan yang mendadak di sini dirasakan oleh mahasiswa semester akhir, khususnya dalam pemberkasan wisuda. Fasilitas di beberapa lembaga/ unit kerja di UMS perlu ditingkatkan, seperti halnya ruang untuk LBIPU yang menurut saya terlalu kecil untuk menampung mahasiswa dari berbagai prodi, walaupun tidak dalam satu waktu/ secara berkala. Hal tersebut dapat membuat staf/ karyawan yang bekerja di situ kurang nyaman, begitu juga dengan para mahasiswa yang harus mengantri. Sekian, terima kasih.","Thank God, during my time as a UMS student, I did not encounter many serious problems related to the performance of BAA UMS services. Judging from the service, I think the officers are also quite friendly and agile. Even if it is found otherwise, there may be some misunderstanding between students and officers. This is very natural to happen. In my opinion, one problem that is often complained about is sudden changes in schedules and bills. Problems regarding schedule changes are usually only conveyed from one person to another without any official announcement (for example, delays in closing ICOLAE article uploads). Sudden bills here are felt by final semester students, especially when submitting graduation applications. Facilities at several institutions/work units at UMS need to be improved, such as the space for LBIPU which in my opinion is too small to accommodate students from various study programs, although not at one time/regularly. This can make the staff/employees who work there uncomfortable, as well as students who have to queue. That is all and thank you.","thank god, during my time as a ums student, i did not encounter many serious problems related to the performance of baa ums services. judging from the service, i think the officers are also quite friendly and agile. even if it is found otherwise, there may be some misunderstanding between students and officers. this is very natural to happen. in my opinion, one problem that is often complained about is sudden changes in schedules and bills. problems regarding schedule changes are usually only conveyed from one person to another without any official announcement (for example, delays in closing icolae article uploads). sudden bills here are felt by final semester students, especially when submitting graduation applications. facilities at several institutions/work units at ums need to be improved, such as the space for lbipu which in my opinion is too small to accommodate students from various study programs, although not at one time/regularly. this can make the staff/employees who work there uncomfortable, as well as students who have to queue. that is all and thank you."

Kemudian supaya mahasiswa melek dalam membaca informasi/pengumuman, dapat ditulis ""BUDAYAKAN MEMBACA, BARU BERTANYA"" . Tujuan ini untuk meminimalisir pertanyaan berulang kepada petugas BAA.
Terima kasih.","All the services are good, but here I also want to convey a few complaints about the academic services at BAA UMS, namely that sometimes the service is not friendly. Then, for example, if there are the same questions from many students, so that it makes the officers tired of answering repeated questions, then it would be better if the frequently asked information could be written down and then pasted in a strategically located announcement place. Then, so that students are literate in reading information/announcements, it can be written ""CULTURE READING, JUST ASK"". This aim is to minimize repeated questions to BAA officers.

saran saya: arahkan mahasiswa kepada bagian yang memberikan solusi yang tepat.

"Maaf, sedikit masukan dari saya, UMS harus lebih komunikatif kepada para mahasiswa, minta tolong bisa dilakukan dengan sosialisasi dan tanya jawab agar tidak terjadi kesalahpahaman. Selain itu, harus lebih tegas dalam memberikan kebenaran informasi. Jika ada informasi penjadwalan dimajukan atau dimundurkan, maka seharusnya seluruh mahasiswa tahu, mahasiswa diberikan akses informasi tersebut, tidak hanya internal atau mahasiswa dosen tertentu saja. Saya merasa pelayanan UMS sudah cukup ramah, hanya saja perlu adanya target untuk meningkatkan kecepatan dalam proses pelayanan, khususnya dalam pelayanan pemberkasan wisuda. Ketepatan yang disetai kecepatan mampu meningkatkan efektifitas dalam proses pelayanan (dalam hal pelayanan apa saja). Terlebih mahasiswa UMS yang jumlahnya tidak sedikit. Tentu diperlukan strategi-strategi bagaimana cara agar seluruh mahasiswa mendapat layanan yang cepat, tetapi juga cepat serta mampu memberikan kesan nyaman pada saat proses layanan dilakukan. Kenyamanan kedua belah pihak tentu harus diperhatikan agar saling menguntungkan. Sekian, terima kasih.","Sorry, a little input from me, UMS must be more communicative with students, asking for help can be done through socialization and questions and answers so that there are no misunderstandings. Apart from that, we must be more assertive in providing truthful information. If scheduling information is moved forward or postponed, then all students should know, students should be given access to this information, not just internal students or students of certain lecturers. I feel that the UMS service is quite friendly, it's just that there needs to be a target to increase the speed of the service process, especially in the graduation registration service. Accuracy accompanied by speed can increase effectiveness in the service process (in terms of any service). Moreover, the number of UMS students is not small. Of course, strategies are needed on how to ensure that all students receive service that is fast, but also fast and able to give a comfortable impression when the service process is carried out. The comfort of both parties must of course be considered so that it is mutually beneficial. That is all and thank you.","sorry, a little input from me, ums must be more communicative with students, asking for help can be done through socialization and questions and answers so that there are no misunderstandings. apart from that, we must be more assertive in providing truthful information. if scheduling information is moved forward or postponed, then all students should know, students should be given access to this information, not just internal students or students of certain lecturers. i feel that the ums service is quite friendly, it's just that there needs to be a target to increase the speed of the service process, especially in the graduation registration service. accuracy accompanied by speed can increase effectiveness in the service process (in terms of any service). moreover, the number of ums students is not small. of course, strategies are needed on how to ensure that all students receive service that is fast, but also fast and able to give a comfortable impression when the service process is carried out. the comfort of both parties must of course be considered so that it is mutually beneficial. that is all and thank you."
