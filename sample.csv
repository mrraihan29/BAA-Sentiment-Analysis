Pelayanan yang dilakukan petugas BAA kepada mahasiswa lebih cenderung tidak ramah bila yang dilayani adalah seorang mahasiswa laki laki. terimakasih.,The service provided by BAA officers to students is more likely to be unfriendly if the person being served is a male student.

"Assalamu'alaikum..
mohon maaf sebelumnya kepada Bapak Ibu di tempat. tanpa mengurangi rasa hormat.
saya menyayangkan oleh pihak BAA. contoh : ketika mengurus biodata diri.
kenapa biodata diri tidak bisa di akses mandiri oleh mahasiswa?
karena ketika ada mahasiswa yang menulis biodata diri terdapat ada kesalahan, mungkin bisa memperbarui sendiri. terimakasih
  ","Assalamu'alaikum..
apologize in advance to the ladies and gentlemen on the spot. with all due respect.
I regret it by BAA. example: when managing personal biodata.
Why can't students access their personal data independently?
because when a student writes their personal bio there are errors, maybe they can update it themselves. Thank You
